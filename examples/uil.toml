title = "Candela"
description = '''
Candela’s teacher, who gives very difficult tests, has announced one for
next week, and has provided her class some preview information about the
questions that will be on the test so that she and her classmates can
strategize about how best to approach it. The information provided by
the teacher only includes the question number, how difficult the
question will be on a scale of 1 to 10, and how many points it will be
worth if it is answered correctly, on a scale of 1 to 20. The worth of
each question does not necessarily match its difficulty, so it is
possible that an easy question will be worth as much if not more than a
difficult question. The total number of points available will exceed the
maximum score of 100 that will be awarded, so students do not have to
answer every question, and will be awarded a score of 100 if they meet
it exactly, or even exceed it.

What Candela and her classmates have done in the past is figured out the level of difficulty they think they can
handle, based on previous efforts, and then strategize to only answer the questions that approach or meet that effort,
hoping for a good score because of their work.

For example, on the last test there were 10 questions with the following point and difficulty levels:

- Q#1: 12 points, difficulty level 8
- Q#2: 10 points, difficulty level 5
- Q#3: 8 points, difficulty level 3
- Q#4: 12 points, difficulty level 4
- Q#5: 7 points, difficulty level 5
- Q#6: 13 points, difficulty level 3
- Q#7: 16 points, difficulty level 2
- Q#8: 2 points, difficulty level 8
- Q#9: 14 points, difficulty level 4
- Q#10: 4 points, difficulty level 5

Being very conscientious about their grades, Candela and her friends
decide to figure out the best approach to maximize their efforts in
getting a decent grade without exceeding their target difficulty level.
The teacher will allow students to bring with them the information
provided, along with any strategies for which questions to attempt to
maximize their test score.

For the last test, the result for Candela was a score of 96, which she
was able to achieve by answering all but question #8, for a total of 96
points and an accumulated difficulty level of 39. She will shoot for a
40 level of difficulty for the text next week. Carla, on the other hand
had earned a test score of 85 with a combined difficulty level of 29,
and therefore thinks 30 is a reasonable difficulty number for her to
attempt.

**Input:** The data file will contain an initial integer $Q$ ($10 <= Q <=
30$), indicating Q questions to follow. Each question data set consists
of two values, an integer P representing the number of points that
question is worth, an integer D indicating the difficulty level of the
question. The first question is Question #1, the second is Question #2,
continuing in that sequence, with the last one as Question #Q. Following
the list of questions, several integers T will follow, each on one line
and each representing a target difficulty level indicated by a student.
There will be only one set of questions to process, but several target
values after the question listing.

**Output:** For each data set, list the target difficulty designated,
the calculated difficulty expected, the total score of the questions the
student has selected to attempt and hopes to achieve, and each question
on the calculated list, shown with the points and difficulty level,
exactly as displayed, formatted and aligned in the examples below. Print

title = "Carla"
description = '''
In the UNIX operating system, Carla has recently learned, each file,
directory, or link is "owned" by a "user", who is a member of a "group",
and has certain "permissions" assigned to it, represented by a
10-character string, such as `drwxrwxrwx`. The first character is 'd',
'-', or 'l' (directory, file, or link), followed by three sets of "rwx"
values, indicating "read, write, execute" permissions. The first set is
the user's rights, the middle set the group's rights, and the third
everyone else's rights to that object.

Permission denied for any of these rights is represented by a '-' in
place of the 'r', 'w', or 'x'. For example, a sample directory
permission string would be `drwxr--r--`, indicating full directory
rights for the user, but "read-only" rights for the group member and all
others.

**Each "rwx" combination can also be represented by an octal value ($0-7$), as shown below:**
| **Octal Value** | **rwx combination** | Interpretation               |
| --------------- | ------------------- |:---------------------------- |
|             $0$ |               `---` | No permission                |
|             $1$ |               `--1` | Execute permission only      |
|             $2$ |               `-1-` | Write permission only        |
|             $3$ |               `-11` | Write and execute permission |
|             $4$ |               `1--` | Read-only permission         |
|             $5$ |               `1-1` | Read and execute only        |
|             $6$ |               `11-` | Read and write only          |
|             $7$ |               `111` | Full permission              |

Given a four-character code string made up of a character 'D', 'F' or
'L', followed by a 3-digit octal integer value, like $664$, output the
resulting 10 character string that represents the permission value
indicated.

**Input:** Several four-character codes as described above, each on one line.

**Output:** The resulting 10-character string based on the criteria described above.

# TODO: Gleb (requires images)

title = "Jeremy"
description = '''
Jeremy knows that bitmap images can be represented by a matrix of
integers, with each integer in the matrix representing the color of a
"pixel". Various editing operations can be performed on a bitmap, but
one of the most common ones is the flood fill. He knows that a flood
fill is a change process that starts at a single pixel, changing every
adjacent pixel that is the same color as the starting pixel (not
including adjacent cells in diagonal directions), to another color. The
process continues for all the pixels that were changed, until an entire
block of color in the picture has been changed. Jeremy needs your help
in creating a program that, given the length and width of a bitmap, a
matrix of integers from 0-9 that represents the bitmap, the starting
pixel, and a "color" from 0-9 to change to, will perform a flood fill
operation on that bitmap.

For example, in this $4 times 7$ matrix, the color at position $(2,2)$ is a 4,
as shown in bold. If this location was changed to the color 6, and then
a flood fill is performed for all neighboring values of 4, resulting in
the second matrix. The remaining 4 in the top right corner stays
unchanged since it is not reachable.

**Input:** An initial integer $N$, representing $N$ data sets to follow.
Each data set consists of two integers $R$ and $C$, indicating an $R
times C$ matrix of integers, which follows on the next $R$ rows. The
matrix consists of single integers in the range $0-9$, with single space
separation. Following the matrix are two integers $A$ and $B$
representing the target location in the matrix, followed by an integer
$D$ as the flood fill color.

**Output:** The resulting matrix after the flood fill operation, which
changes all instances of the color integer at location $(A, B)$ to the
color integer $D$, as described above and shown in the examples below.

title = "Layla"
description = '''
Layla is considering a thought experiment in measurement systems,
different than metric or the traditional English system, perhaps ones
that remote civilizations, or even aliens on different worlds might
develop. She wants to allow for three levels of measure, like meters,
kilometers, and centimeters, all members of the metric system. Just as
it takes $100$ centimeters to make a meter, and 1000 meters to make a
kilometer, she wants to consider other systems with other conversion
values.

For purposes of consistency, she decides to label the three units of
measure as $A$, $B$ and $C$, and then express the conversions as
follows: $B = x A$ and $C = y B$, where $x$ and $y$ are real values
greater than $1$.

In the metric system, $A$, $B$ and $C$ would be centimeters, meters and
kilometers, and $x$ and $y$ would be $100$ and $1000$. To express $5$
meters in terms of centimeters and kilometers, she would mathematically
convert them using the values of $100$ and $1000$, resulting in $500$
$A$ units (centimeters), and $0.005$ $C$ units (kilometers). In her
experiment, $A$ will always be the smallest unit and $C$ the largest.

In one possible random system, the values of $x$ and $y$ might be $16$
and $7$, which would mean that $B = 16A$, and $C = 7B$. She then would
take a value, express it in one measure, and then convert it into
equivalent values in the other two measures. $17$ units of $B$ would
convert into $272$ $A$ units and $2.429$ $C$ units. Three $C$ units in
the same system would be equivalent to $336$ $A$ units and $21$ $B$
units.

**Input:** Several sets of data, each on one line, consisting of two
integer values $x$ and $y$, a value $d$, and a character $c$, all with
single space separation.

description = '''
Nandita has learned that in some areas of the world the standard format for
abbreviating a date differs from others, like the traditional `month/day/year`
abbreviation method used often in the US. For example, in her research she has
discovered that some may express `APRIL 15, 2018` as `04/15/18` (called "middle
endian" format), others may use `15.04.2018` ("little endian" format), and still
others `2018-04-15` ("big endian").

| Endianness    | Order            | Example      |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| middle-endian | month, day, year | `04/15/18  ` |
| little-endian | day, month, year | `15.04.2018` |
| big-endian    | year, month, day | `2018-04-15` |
